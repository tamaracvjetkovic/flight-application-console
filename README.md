# Author's Note üìù

This was my first project ever, both personal and academic. 

The code is messy, clean code principles are non-existent, but I gave it my all to build the best application I could with the skills I had at that time.
I even made a custom colored menu for each user role, using the colored library for python (for example, VIP‚≠ê users see their menu options in gold) :)
